  <div class="centered1"><h4>About Us</h4><p2>We started as a little group of freinds who would occasionally
      make articles to show to others. Over time more people wanted to join and more people joining means more articles.
      Eventually we started producing articles on a regular bases and decided to call ourselves HVMS Unofficial News. After making articles and comics for a couple weeks we decided we wanted to bacome official so we talked to the principals and they said they would talk to us about it. We waited a couple weeks but they still had'nt talked to us about it so we asked Mrs.Cline (the sixth grade pricapal) she said we could sit at a certain table in the front of the cafeteria during lunch and call it the newspaper table from there we hired even more people and changed our name to what it is today- Hidden Valley Times or HVT for short. After that we decided that not enough people where reading our articles our solotion was to make a TV show so more people would watch because its TV we decided to call it HVTV. We decided to record on thursdays and on the second thurday we recorded we finally got some videos we liked these where    ,  and        . Now we are trying to show these at lunch on the projector screen.</p2>
